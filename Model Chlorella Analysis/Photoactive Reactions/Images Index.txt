Vitamin D3 Synthesis Activity Spectrum
    Figure 1.b. The action spectrum of preD3 formation from 7-DHC in human epidermis (0) and the spectral irradiance curve for sunlight (----). The action spectrum was obtained by plotting the reciprocal of the dose as a function of wavelength. At any wavelength, no more than 5 percent of product was made. The overlay of the curve of the action spectrum with that of the solar spectrum demonstrates the small portion of the solar UV spectrum that is involved with the production of preD3 from 7-DHC.

Rhodopsin photoisomerase Activity Spectrum
    Figure 5. Action spectra for photoreceptor currents in CSRA-enriched and CSRB-enriched cells. Sensitivity is the relative effectiveness of monochromatic light determined from fluence-response curves as the reciprocal of the fluence that gives a photoreceptor-current amplitude equal to that at a reference wavelength (500 nm for CSRA and 470 nm for CSRB), expressed in percent of the reference value. Spectra were measured at fluences of ≈1 μE/m2 (1 μE = 1 μmol of photons). Reproducibility was better than 90%.
